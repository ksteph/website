<div class="subheading mb-1">Student Help-Seeking Behavior (Help-seeking)</div>
<p>
Academic help-seeking is a metacognitive and self-regulated learning strategy central to students' academic achievement. Building on existing empirical works that primarily focus on a single course context, a single (type of) help resource, or a single snapshot in students' learning paths, our research instead seeks to holistically characterize computing students' help-seeking approaches and behavior across computing learning contexts, across help resources, and over time in quantitative studies, aiming to inform fairer and more effective designs of help ecosystems in large-scale computing contexts. This line of work has been published at premier venues in computing education research, including ICER, SIGCSE TS, ITiCSE, and TOCE.

<div class="subheading mb-1">AI and Learning (AI Learning)</div>
<p>This project explores how AI can be used to support (human) learning. We've explored how students incorporate chatbots into their processes to enhance their learning. We are now trying to understand how students can integrate AI into their learning to support it, rather than hinder or short-circuit it.</p>

<div class="subheading mb-1">Hybrid, Flipped, Just-in-time Teaching (HyFlJit)</div>
<p>This line of work intertwines closely with what happens in the classroom. We mean hybrid as students can attend class online synchronously. Flipping class material involves students consuming learning materials outside the classroom, taking pre-class quizzes on that content, and applying their learning in the classroom. Just-in-time means the quiz results are analyzed and used to inform what is covered and focused on in class.</p>

<div class="subheading mb-1">Open-Ended Autogradable Assignments (OEA Assign)</div>
<p>Autograders help us improve CS teaching by enabling us to give students instant feedback. However, autograders often focus on expecting students to write code that behaves the same. Given specific inputs, the code should return the exact same output regardless of which student submission the autograder is checking. This research project explores breaking that paradigm. How can we design assignments that allow students to be creative while also enabling us to autograde these assignments for the core learning objectives they are assessing?</p>

<div class="subheading mb-1">Course Impacts on Students (Impacts)</div>
<p>There are many aspects of a class that impact student attitudes and affect. This research work investigates that broadly. This work considers students' sense of belonging, self-efficacy, self-assessment, and attitudes. It then considers how activities that encourage ecological belonging, universal design for learning principles, and group work impact students.</p>

<div class="subheading mb-1">UTA and student diversity (Diversity)</div>
<p>This work examines the diversity of students and undergraduate teaching assistants (UTAs). We are exploring the relationship between the demographic diversity of these two groups, such as the historical changes over time and the impact on shared identity between them.</p>

<div class="subheading mb-1">Helping Novices Debug Relational Queries (HNRQ)</div>
<p>
This project is with <a href="https://users.cs.duke.edu/~junyang/">Jun Yang</a> and <a href="https://users.cs.duke.edu/~sudeepa/">Sudeepa Roy</a>. Our goal is to create an interactive debugger called I-Rex for SQL. <a href="https://users.cs.duke.edu/~sudeepa/papers/SIGMOD2019-ratest.pdf">I-Rex</a> allows users to interactively "trace" through SQL queries, understand how they execute, and debug wrong queries.
</p>
<p>
My work on this project focuses on the learning and user experience of the tool. So far, we've run preliminary user studies to learn about the overall study experience. Other ideas we have for this project include: (1) Conducting cognitive walkthrough while an expert is debugging for the sake of designing a debugging process for beginners, (2) A controlled learning gains study while learners are using the tool, and (3) More user studies.

<div class="subheading mb-1">CS101 Reviewer App and Formative Assessments (Reviewer)</div>
<p>
<a href="https://cs101-quiz.cs.duke.edu/">CS101 Reviewer App</a> is a web application that provides an online quiz tool to students enrolled in CS101 at Duke University. It enables students to quiz themselves on CS101 topics with carefully designed questions that check for specific misunderstandings. These questions are computer generated from a template. Formative assessments are course materials that seek to identify a studet's current understanding of the material. This project includes improving the Reviewer app and investigating assessments generally in a course with a focus on formative assessments.
