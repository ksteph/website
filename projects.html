<div class="subheading mb-1">Student Help-Seeking Behavior (Help-seeking)</div><p>
Using data from office hours, class forum and class materials, this project focuses on understanding student help-seeking behavior. Which students are seeking help? Where are they seeking help? What kind of help are students seeking? What kind of help are students receiving? How do we encourage students to seek help only when they need it? How do we improve the help students are receiving?

We've explored how students incorporate chatbots into their processes to enhance their learning. We are now trying to understand how students can integrate AI into their learning to support it, rather than hinder or short-circuit it.</p><p>

We mean hybrid as students can attend class online synchronously. Flipping class material involves students consuming learning materials outside the classroom, taking pre-class quizzes on that content, and applying their learning in the classroom. Just-in-time means the quiz results are analyzed and used to inform what is covered and focused on in class.</p><p>

However, autograders often focus on expecting students to write code that behaves the same. Given specific inputs, the code should return the exact same output regardless of which student submission the autograder is checking. This research project explores breaking that paradigm. How can we design assignments that allow students to be creative while also enabling us to autograde these assignments for the core learning objectives they are assessing?</p><p>

This research work investigates that broadly. This work considers students' sense of belonging, self-efficacy, self-assessment, and attitudes. It then considers how activities that encourage ecological belonging, universal design for learning principles, and group work impact students.</p><p>

This project is with <a href="https://users.cs.duke.edu/~junyang/">Jun Yang</a> and <a href="https://users.cs.duke.edu/~sudeepa/">Sudeepa Roy</a>. Our goal is to create an interactive debugger called I-Rex for SQL. <a href="https://users.cs.duke.edu/~sudeepa/papers/SIGMOD2019-ratest.pdf">I-Rex</a> allows users to interactively "trace" through SQL queries, understand how they execute, and debug wrong queries.
</p>
<p>
My work on this project focuses on the learning and user experience of the tool. So far, we've run preliminary user studies to learn about the overall study experience. Other ideas we have for this project include: (1) Conducting cognitive walkthrough while an expert is debugging for the sake of designing a debugging process for beginners, (2) A controlled learning gains study while learners are using the tool, and (3) More user studies.

<a href="https://cs101-quiz.cs.duke.edu/">CS101 Reviewer App</a> is a web application that provides an online quiz tool to students enrolled in CS101 at Duke University. It enables students to quiz themselves on CS101 topics with carefully designed questions that check for specific misunderstandings. These questions are computer generated from a template. Formative assessments are course materials that seek to identify a studet's current understanding of the material. This project includes improving the Reviewer app and investigating assessments generally in a course with a focus on formative assessments.
